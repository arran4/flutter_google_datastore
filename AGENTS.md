# Repository Guidelines

## Testing

- Run tests using `flutter test`.
- If Flutter is not installed, download and extract the stable release from:
  https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.32.4-stable.tar.xz
- Extract Flutter to a suitable directory (for example, `/usr/local/flutter`)
  and add its `bin/` directory to `PATH` so `flutter` commands are available.
